When client logs in, the submit button calls a function on the server named setname(), which then calls getplayers() (found in the client script) which prints out a list of users.


Right now, the client is drawing a block everytime the user presses a key, and a keypress is called by the server to make the player in the firstplace (I think) when the user signs in.

What I did:
- Made the setname() function (on the server) call the below function:

	CPlayerList = new Array(); // an array of player objects
	socket.on('playercreate', function (username, pos, ID) {
		console.log("Playercreate()");
		var Player = new ClientPlayer();
		Player.Create(username, pos, ID);
		CPlayerList.push(Player);
		console.log(JSON.stringify(CPlayerList)); 
    }); 
	
	

I should:
- make each player be drawn when the userlist is generated, generating a block for each player.
- then move the users block on client keypress.
